# Integration Requirements
integration_checklist:
  - "Passes all unit tests"
  - "Follows domain model patterns"
  - "Compatible with existing ReactionBase interface"
  - "No external dependencies beyond domain layer"
  - "Proper error handling and logging"

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_tests:
  - description: "Disagree reaction can be created and validated"
    steps:
      - "Instantiate DisagreeReaction"
      - "Create valid ReactionContext"
      - "Call validation_hooks() - should succeed"
      - "Call build_event() - should return valid ReactionEvent"

  - description: "Disagree reaction promotes constructive discourse"
    steps:
      - "Create disagree reaction with PUBLIC visibility"
      - "Verify constructive discourse metadata"
      - "Test with ANONYMOUS visibility for sensitive disagreement"
