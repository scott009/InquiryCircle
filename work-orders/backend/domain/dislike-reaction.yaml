      description: "Test successful validation with valid context"
      setup:
        - "Create valid ReactionContext"
        - "Set participant as active"
      assertions:
        - "No exception raised"

    - name: "test_validation_inactive_participant"
      description: "Test validation failure for inactive participant"
      setup:
        - "Create ReactionContext with inactive participant"
      assertions:
        - "ValidationError raised"

    - name: "test_event_building"
      description: "Test reaction event creation"
      setup:
        - "Create valid context with target"
      assertions:
        - "Event contains correct reaction_code"
        - "Event includes participant information"
        - "Event has proper timestamp"

    - name: "test_visibility_modes"
      description: "Test all supported visibility modes"
      test_matrix:
        visibility_modes: ["PUBLIC", "ANONYMOUS", "ACCREDITED", "SECRET"]
      assertions:
        - "Event respects visibility setting"
        - "Redaction applied for ANONYMOUS mode"

    - name: "test_negative_feedback_handling"
      description: "Test appropriate handling of negative feedback"
      setup:
        - "Create context with different visibility modes"
      assertions:
        - "Anonymous mode preserves privacy for negative feedback"
        - "Public mode still allows constructive criticism"

# Integration Requirements
integration_checklist:
  - "Passes all unit tests"
  - "Follows domain model patterns"
  - "Compatible with existing ReactionBase interface"
  - "No external dependencies beyond domain layer"
  - "Proper error handling and logging"

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_tests:
  - description: "Dislike reaction can be created and validated"
    steps:
      - "Instantiate DislikeReaction"
      - "Create valid ReactionContext"
      - "Call validation_hooks() - should succeed"
      - "Call build_event() - should return valid ReactionEvent"

  - description: "Dislike reaction respects visibility modes"
    steps:
      - "Test with PUBLIC visibility - full participant info"
      - "Test with ANONYMOUS visibility - redacted participant info"
      - "Test with SECRET visibility - facilitator-only"

# Code Quality Standards
quality_requirements:
  - "Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines"
  - "Include comprehensive docstrings"
  - "Use type hints for all method signatures"
  - "Handle edge cases gracefully"
  - "Include debug logging where appropriate"

# Deliverables
expected_outputs:
  - "dislike_reaction.py - Complete class implementation"
  - "test_dislike_reaction.py - Comprehensive test suite"
