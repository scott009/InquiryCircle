        An Inquiry Circle is a place to come together in honest, respectful conversation.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Each Circle is a small online meeting room where people take turns sharing and listening around a common question or theme. We offer meeting facilitators a flexible set of tools to shape the meeting environment—helping them create the kind of space that best fits their group's needs.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Inquiry Circles began in small Buddhist-based recovery communities where people met to talk honestly about change, suffering, and growth. Those conversations shaped the focus on mindful listening and shared understanding, but the approach is open to anyone who values honest dialogue and mutual respect.
